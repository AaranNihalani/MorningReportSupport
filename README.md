## How to Publish (GitHub Pages)

1.  **Commit** this directory to your repository.
2.  Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
3.  Scroll down to the **Pages** section (or "GitHub Pages").
4.  Under **Source**, select `main` branch (or `master`) and select the `/support-website` folder (if GitHub allows selecting a subfolder other than `/docs`).
